I'm an R Markdown document! 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r echo = FALSE}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# learning assessment

This is code for the learning assessment at P8105

```{r}

la_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(n = 500, mean = 1),
    samp_g0 = norm_samp >0,
    abs_v_samp = abs(norm_samp)
  )

ggplot(la_df, aes(x  = abs_v_samp)) +
  geom_histogram()

```
